The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project.

 Step 1.Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

        Assign each data to variables
        features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
        The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
        activity.labels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
        List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
        test.subject <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
        contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
        test.x <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
        contains recorded features test dat
        test.y <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
        contains test data of activity labels
        train.subject <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
        contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
        train.x <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
        contains recorded train data
        train.y <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
        contains train data of activitiesâ€™code labels

        Creates the training and the test set dataframes and merge to create one data set
        test.df (2947 rows, 563 columns) is created by including test.subject, test.y, test.x into one dataframe
        train.df (7352 rows, 563 columns) is created by including train.subject, train.y, train.x into one dataframe
        combine.df (10299 rows, 563 columns) is created by merging test.df and train.df using rbind() function
        names(combined.df) is created yb merging "subject","activity" and features by using c function
        
Step 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
        Use grep function to locate the names(combined.df) that either contain mean or std 
        Pick out those columns together with sbuject and activity to form the new combined.df (10299 rows, 81 columns)

Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        Update the activity column of combine.df with descriptive activity names based on activity.labels 

Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
        Remove "()" from variables names
        Replace "-" with "_"
        Replace starting "t" with "time_"
        Replace starting "f" with "frequency_"
        Replace "Acc" with "Accelerometer"
        Replace "Gyro" with "Gyroscope"
        Replace "Mag" with "Magnitude"
        Replace "std" with "standarddeviation"

 Step 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
        Use aggregate function to take the average of each column in combine.df
        Use write.table function to write the data to "data.tidy.txt"
